It's used for all sorts of tasks including web programming and data analysis; and it's emerged as the language to learn for machine learning. That popularity means that python developers are in demand and python programming jobs can be lucrative.\n\nThe above mentioned reasons are why it might be a good idea for you to learn how to program in Python. This module will provide an introduction to using Python to build an app, which can be a starting point to becoming a Python programmer.\n\n### Learning objectives\n* Explore the choices available to run Python apps\n* Use the Python interpreter to execute statements and scripts\n* Learn how to declare variables\n","block_group":"a1c8dd0c29404961813424ec534df93d"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"d1a5ac8669bf4c288bed1bfea8c6b357","deepnote_cell_height":488.71875,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"#### What is Python?\n\nPython is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.\n\nPython is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Created in the early 1990s, it enjoys a wide range of uses from automating repetitive tasks and writing web apps to building machine learning models and implementing neural networks. Researchers, mathematicians, and data scientists in particular like Python because of its rich and easy-to-understand syntax and the wide range of open-source packages available. Packages are commonly used, shared code libraries that are freely available for anyone to use.\n\nPython has a simple, easy to learn syntax, which emphasizes readability. Applications written in Python can run on almost any computer, including those running Windows, macOS, and popular distributions of Linux. Furthermore, the ecosystem contains a rich set of development tools for writing, debugging, and publishing Python applications.\n\nFinally, Python is supported by an active user community that is eager to help new programmers learn the Pythonic way where you don't just get the syntax right, but use the language the way it was intended.","block_group":"d1a5ac8669bf4c288bed1bfea8c6b357"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"aaf0cdd4916446f8815f2416953a9e59","deepnote_cell_height":383.34375,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"#### Running Python code\n\nPython is an interpreted language, which reduces the edit-test-debug cycle because there's no compilation step required. In order to run Python apps, you need a runtime environment/interpreter to execute the code.\n\nMost of the runtime environments support two ways to execute Python code:\n\n* **Interactive mode:** in this mode, each command you type is interpreted and executed immediately and you see the results each time you press ENTER. The interactive mode is the default mode if you don't pass a filename to the interpreter.\n\n* **Script mode:** in script mode, you put a set of Python statements into a text file with a .py extension. You then run the python interpreter and point it at the file. The program is executed line-by-line and the output is displayed. There is no compilation step as shown in the following diagram.\n\n\n![]()","block_group":"aaf0cdd4916446f8815f2416953a9e59"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"56f1e5c3865946a59b63ec363df3ffe7","deepnote_cell_height":284.59375,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"![Picture title](image-20211207-110951.png)","block_group":"56f1e5c3865946a59b63ec363df3ffe7"},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"3a1ff892821c41beaa3469c0f642f645","deepnote_cell_height":66,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"# Start writing code here...","block_group":"3a1ff892821c41beaa3469c0f642f645","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a style='text-decoration:none;line-height:16px;display:flex;color:#5B5B62;padding:10px;justify-content:end;' href='https://deepnote.com?utm_source=created-in-deepnote-cell&projectId=9d7d3e2f-71d5-43c9-951e-bea362fb428e' target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt='Created in deepnote.com' style='display:inline;max-height:16px;margin:0px;margin-right:7.5px;' src='data:image/svg+xml;base64,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' > </img>\nCreated in <span style='font-weight:600;margin-left:4px;'>Deepnote</span></a>","metadata":{"created_in_deepnote_cell":true,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0,"metadata":{"deepnote":{"is_reactive":false},"orig_nbformat":2,"deepnote_notebook_id":"3ae66789efa5410290d74253bf532f0c","deepnote_execution_queue":[]}}
